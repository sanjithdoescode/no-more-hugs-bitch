public visibility, to induce shame. 

## what
i have been facing many mental issues lately. i feel like, a change in my mindset would help. this is a step towards that. what i am doing is that i am taking responsibility for my own well being. 

what i am trying to do is that, everytime when i feel down, everytime when i feel angry, about the human society, or myself, i calm myself down, and work on -- something. anything. 

this will serve as a record to myself, of how i have been improving. everytime i screw the pooch, i will build something, learn something, do something productive. something anything whathing nothing ohthing thing thing

i'll add .md files linking to the project/work i've done. that will serve as proof.

i am excited to begin this journey, and take responsibility of my unhealthy, unhappy life. let's do this.
